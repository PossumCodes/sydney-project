            <h2>Why Sydney?</h2>
            <h3>Sydney, the Harbour City</h3>
            <p>
              Sydney is the capital city of the state of New South Wales, and
              the most populous city in Australia. During his first Pacific
              voyage in 1770, James Cook charted the eastern coast of Australia,
              making landfall at Botany Bay. In 1788, the First Fleet of
              convicts, led by Arthur Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal
              colony, the first European settlement in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aboriginal Australians have inhabited the Greater Sydney region
              for at least 30,000 years, and Aboriginal engravings and cultural
              sites are common throughout Greater Sydney. The traditional
              custodians of the land on which modern Sydney stands are the clans
              of the Darug, Dharawal and Eora peoples.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sydney has hosted major international sporting events such as the
              2000 Summer Olympics. The city is among the top fifteen
              most-visited cities in the world, with millions of tourists coming
              each year to see the city's landmarks. The city has over 1,000,000
              ha (2,500,000 acres) of nature reserves and parks, and its notable
              natural features include Sydney Harbour and Royal National Park.
              The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the World Heritage-listed Sydney
              Opera House are major tourist attractions. Central Station is the
              hub of Sydney's rail network, and the main passenger airport
              serving the city is Kingsford Smith Airport, one of the world's
              oldest continually operating airports.
